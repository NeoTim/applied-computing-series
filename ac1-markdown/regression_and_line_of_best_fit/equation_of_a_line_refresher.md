Equation of a Line (Refresher)
==============================

![Slope intercept form: y equals m times x plus b.](figures/equation_of_a_line.png)

All line equations in this text will be presented in the form *y = mx +
b*, where *m* is the slope and *b* is the y-intercept. This is also
called slope-intercept form. The **y-intercept** is the y-value at the
point where the line crosses the y-axis. The
[slope](interpreting_slope.md) gives the
steepness of the line, and can be positive, negative, or zero.
Slope-intercept form is a method to better understand the relationship
between the two variables *x* and *y*.

![A graph of the equation y equals negative one third times x plus five and the slope is negative.](figures/negative_slope.png)

This figure depicts an equation of a line that has a y-intercept of 5
and a negative slope.

![A graph of the equation of y equals 2 times x plus one.](figures/positive_slope.png)

The equation of the line in the above figure has a y-intercept of 1 and
a positive slope.
