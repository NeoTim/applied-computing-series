Introduction
============

As mentioned in the preface, SQL (which stands for Structured Query
Language) is a programming language that is used to get, store, and
change information in a database. SQL is one of the most widely used
programming languages today, and can be used in any field where there is
data.

You may be wondering when you would need to use SQL since you already
know how to use Sheets. SQL does many of the things that you have
learned in the previous sections, but it also does them on a much larger
scale. Imagine a spreadsheet with one billion rows!

You can use SQL to analyze anything from stock market prices to patient
data at a major hospital. If you have a database with any kind of data,
you can use SQL to store and analyze it. In addition, SQL allows you to
reorganize data across different datasets. This chapter will teach you
how to use SQL to automate data analysis so that you can effectively
navigate large datasets that might be cumbersome to navigate by hand.
