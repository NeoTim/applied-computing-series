.. _creating_line_of_best_fit:


After making a scatter plot, you can add a line of best fit by opening the chart
editor. Under “Series”, there is a checkbox to add a trendline. You can change
the color and thickness of the line, display the R2 value, (this is the same
coefficient of determination as described `above <#correlation>`__), and display
the equation of the line.

You can also find the slope and intercept of this line using the *SLOPE()* and\_
INTERCEPT()\_ functions in Sheets.
