How to Use SQL
==============

This section will teach you some of the basic commands to analyze large datasets
in SQL. In the interactive version of this textbook, there is a SQL interpreter.
However, when using SQL outside of the textbook, including in your project, you
will need to run SQL somewhere else. In order to do this, there are many
options. If you are using SQL for just this course, you can use an online
interpreter, such as this one.

- `SQL Online Interpreter`_

Ultimately, if you plan on using SQL for more robust purposes, you will want to
run SQL queries on your own machine. To do this, you will need to download a
Database Engine and set up a Database Client. There are many options for
database engines you can use. Some of the most popular ones are listed below.
Each link takes you to the setup documentation for the database engine. Pick
one that feels right to you and follow the instructions.

- `MySQL`_
- `PostgreSQL`_
- `SQLite`_
