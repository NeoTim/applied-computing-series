Project Description
-------------------

In this project, you will design a survey to answer a research question of your
own, and then share the results.

Here are the steps you’ll need to complete.
 
**Step 1: Choose a Research Question**

In a group, decide on a research question. Your question should ask about the 
relationship between two or more attributes. 

Examples of good research questions include:

- Does handedness (left or right) have an impact on whether you played a sport
  in high school? 
- Do people who have dogs walk more than people who don’t?

An example of an inadequate research question would be: 

- What percent of people are left-handed? (This question only involves one 
  attribute.) 

**To Do:**

- Form a group of no more than 4 people. (You may want to form a group with 
  people who are in a similar major or have similar interests as this may make 
  question selection easier.)
- Choose a research question that asks about the relationship between two or 
  more attributes. 
 
**Step 2: Design and Deploy a Survey** 

You will need to design a survey with relevant questions to help answer your 
research question. Remember to create clear questions that elicit specific 
answers. Then deploy your survey and collect at least 30 responses.

**To Do:**

- Design a survey with clear and relevant questions to answer your research 
  question. 
- Deploy the survey and collect at least 30 responses. 

*Hint:*
Having trouble getting enough responses, or want more participants? Try social 
media!
 
**Step 3: Analyze your Data** 

Analyze your dataset by calculating summary statistics for the groups of 
interest. Remember to answer your research question, though you may have other 
insights you’d like to share as well.

**To Do:**

- Subset the data in a way that helps you answer your research question.  
  (For instance, in the example question above, you would subset the data into 
  left-handed people and right-handed people.)
- Do some basic data cleaning of the data if necessary. 
- Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, and variance) 
  from your data for each subset and compare the statistics for the groups of 
  interest.

*Hint:* 
If you are unsure how to clean your data, `read this.`_
 

**Step 4: Visualize your Findings and Share your Results** 

Visualize your findings through whatever chart types you find useful. Then 
share your results with the class by creating a slide deck. 

**To Do:** 

- Create a visual for your findings using chart types of your choice. Include a 
  few sentences on what each chart conveys. 
- Make a slide deck to share with the class that includes answers to the following. 

  - What is your research question?
  - Where did your data come from?
  - What is your answer to the research question?
  - What are possible sources of bias, and how would you improve your study 
    next time?

*Hint:* 
If you need help creating helpful visuals, re-visit :ref:`this checklist on 
creating visualizations <creating_visualization_checklist>`. 

**Step 5: Submit your Materials**

Submit everything you used in each of the above steps.

**To Do:** 

- Submit your slides, sheet used for analysis, and a link to your survey by 
  [Due Date].
- Optional (faculty can decide whether to include or not): After completing and 
  submitting your project, complete the group work self assessment and group 
  assessment.

   * -
     - **Excellent**
     - **Developing**
     - **Beginning**
     - **NA / Not Present**

   * - **Research Question (4)**
     - Research question is included in the slides. Question is clear and
       specific and relates to at least two attributes.
     - Question has minor issues with clarity or specificity.
     - Question is unclear or not specific, or the question is about a single
       attribute.
     - There is no research question.

   * - **Survey Questions (8)**
     - Survey questions are clear and can be used to answer the research
       question.
     - Survey questions are unclear or inappropriate/irrelevant for answering
       the research question.
     - Survey questions are unclear and inappropriate/irrelevant for answering
       the research question.
     - Survey questions not submitted.

   * - **Survey Responses (4)**
     - 30 or more responses are collected.
     - Between 15 and 29 responses are collected.
     - Fewer than 15 responses are collected.
     - No responses are collected.

   * - **Survey Sources (6)**
     - Methods for recruiting participants are outlined in the slides.
     - Methods for recruiting participants are outlined in the slides, but in
       insufficient depth.
     - Methods for recruiting participants are mentioned in the slides, but not
       discussed.
     - Methods for recruiting participants are not outlined in the slides.

   * - **Statistical Analysis (8)**
     - Analysis includes a complete and data-supported comparison of the two
       groups of interest in the research question. This includes a comparison
       of centers (mean and median) and spread (standard deviation and/or
       variance).
     - There is an attempt at a statistical analysis to answer the research
       question but there are minor errors or inconsistencies.

       groups in the research question.
     - The slides have no mention of a statistical comparison of two groups.

   * - **Visualization (6)**
     - Visualizations are accurate, relevant to the research question, and well
       presented.
     - Visualizations are broadly relevant to the research question but either
       contain inaccuracies or are not well presented.
     - Visualizations are not completely accurate or relevant to the research
       question.
     - Slides do not include a visualization.

   * - **Summary of Results (4)**
